* The main focus of the projects in this repository is to show the effective use of SASS.
* All the projects are responsive for every screen size, except the "Welcome page" project.
* The breakpoints for the screen sizes are as follows:
    *Small- 576px
    *Medium- 768px
    *Large- 992px
    *Extra large- 1200px
                              -(px= Pixels)

*A little bit of Javascript may be included in some projects to toggle the navigation bar(only in small screen sizes[ 576px ]).
